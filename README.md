This is a cozy and somewhat puzzely Third-Person Adventure Platformer with a very simple core mechanic:

*Find button -> Press button -> Things happen!*

The idea behind this simple concept is to create level layouts that can be easily recontextualized in various creative ways.

This game was developed as a student project in 8 weeks at S4G School for Games in Berlin. It was released on [itch.io](https://s4g.itch.io/sparks-way-home) in August 2024.
